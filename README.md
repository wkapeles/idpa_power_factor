# idpa_power_factor
This app is used by match directors of IDPA pistol matches to determine if a competitor's ammunition meets the minimum velocity vs. projectile mass requirements.  It can be used for any competitor division and any grain bullet weight.  The app creates a SQLite database on the hard drive if one does not already exist.  The results are stored in it and can be exported to a txt file when testing is complete.
